Some ideas of things that still need to be implemented:
* Fix so cities with spaces work such as "/time/europe/new york".
* Add a "/country" option and that you can get information for example "/country/sweden/population" would give the pulation of sweden etc etc.
* make it so the lambda script is more optimized exit when required the faster it runs the cheaper.
* split everything into multiple lambda functions, so people only have to use what they require.
* add the "/weather" option to get weather for countries and cities.
* better documentation on github.
* better documentation in api gateway.
* add main page with api commands when going to domain.
* add proper error pages if lambda does not show output, api gateway should show 404.
* create a cloudformation template to set things up automatically.
